Welcome to PrepNGp. Brought to you By Jodan Elysee and Gregory Dort!

PrepNGo is a website where users can list out ingredients in a search bar, and the site will return a list of dishes including the ingredients the user sent. Users can create accounts to save the recipes as well for later use. Each recipe will list all the ingredients needed, instructions to make the dish, and a video for visual learners.

This project uses the MERN Stack (MongoDB, express.js, react, node.js). We are also using TailwindCSS for styling.

Later variations of this project will use an AI component to return dishes for the user.

To run the porject locally, you must run "npm start" in the backend folder and run "npm run dev" in the frontend folder. You might have to npm dependencies in the frontend and backend folders. 

For the Hackathon, you must use a hotspot when running the backend to connect to mongoDB, you must be connected to a hotspot since rutgers wifi has mongoDB blocked. 

Hope you guys Enjoy!
